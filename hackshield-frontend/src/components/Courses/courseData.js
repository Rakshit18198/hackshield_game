## Key Cybersecurity Principles

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals
2. **Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data
3. **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed

## Best Practices

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Keep software updated
- Be cautious with email attachments and links

# Password Security

## The Importance of Strong Passwords

Passwords are often the first line of defense against unauthorized access. Weak passwords are one of the most common security vulnerabilities.

## Characteristics of Strong Passwords

### Length
- Minimum 12 characters
- Longer is generally better
- Each additional character exponentially increases security

### Complexity
- Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special characters
- Avoid predictable patterns

### Uniqueness
- Different password for each account
- Avoid reusing passwords
- Don't use variations of the same password

## Common Password Mistakes

### Weak Passwords
- Dictionary words
- Personal information (birthdays, names)
- Sequential characters (123456, abcdef)
- Common passwords (password, admin, qwerty)

### Poor Password Practices
- Writing passwords down in visible places
- Sharing passwords with others
- Using the same password everywhere
- Never changing passwords

## Creating Strong Passwords

### Passphrase Method
Create a sentence and use the first letter of each word:
"I love to eat pizza on Fridays at 7pm!"
becomes: "IltepooFa7p!"

### Substitution Method
Replace letters with numbers and symbols:
"MySecurePassword123"
becomes: "MyS3cur3P@ssw0rd123"

### Random Generation
Use password managers to generate random passwords:
"K9#mL2$vN8@xQ5"

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### What is MFA?
Additional security layer requiring multiple forms of verification:
1. **Something you know** (password)
2. **Something you have** (phone, token)
3. **Something you are** (fingerprint, face)

### Types of MFA
- SMS codes
- Authenticator apps
- Hardware tokens
- Biometric verification

## Password Managers

### Benefits
- Generate strong, unique passwords
- Store passwords securely
- Auto-fill login forms
- Sync across devices
- Monitor for breached passwords

### Popular Password Managers
- LastPass
- 1Password
- Bitwarden
- Dashlane
- KeePass

## Password Policies

### Organizational Guidelines
